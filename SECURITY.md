# Security

WSurf keeps API keys in the macOS Keychain. An agent operates live web pages,
and the app installs extensions from the Chrome Web Store. If you find a
security defect in one of these areas, report it privately.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting on this repository
([**Security › Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/wsagency/wsurf/security/advisories/new)).
Do not open a public issue for an exploitable vulnerability.

You get an acknowledgment in one week or less. There is no bounty program,
because this is a small open-source project. The release notes give credit to
each person who reports a defect. If you do not want this credit, say so in
your report.

## Scope

- External MCP connections (`WSurf/MCP`). Connecting must disclose no browser
  data without an explicit tab-and-origin grant. Site denials, read-only access,
  private browsing, revocation, and profile boundaries also apply. A connection
  must not inherit the assistant's consequential-action approvals or operate
  controls from another connection's observation.
- The assistant’s action policy. The assistant asks before it does anything
  with consequences, and refuses to fill a sensitive field
  (`WSurf/Web/Privacy/SensitiveAction.swift`,
  `WSurf/Web/Assistant/AgentActionPolicy.swift`).
- Installing, verifying and updating extensions
  (`WSurf/Extensions/CRXVerifier.swift`,
  `WSurf/Extensions/ExtensionUpdates.swift`). WSurf checks the Chrome Web Store
  for updates daily. Updates requiring additional access wait for user approval.
  Granting that access without approval is a defect.
- Credentials (`WSurf/Agent/Providers/CredentialStore.swift`). A key goes only
  in the Authorization header of the provider it belongs to.
- Download filenames (`WSurf/Web/System/DownloadManager.swift`). The app does
  not run in a sandbox, so treat a filename from a server as a path until you
  have proved it safe. WSurf quarantines each completed file for Gatekeeper to
  examine, and a path that skips the quarantine stamp is a defect. The list of
  finished downloads is written to disk; a private download never is.
- Certificate exceptions (`WSurf/Web/Privacy/CertificateTrust.swift`). WSurf
  sends every server-trust challenge to the system and allows certificate
  exceptions only when enabled in Privacy settings. An exception belongs to one
  host paired with one certificate fingerprint. The app holds it in memory only.
  A path that accepts a certificate without a prompt, that keeps an exception
  after the setting goes off, or that applies an exception to a different
  certificate on the same host, is a defect.
- Profile separation (`WSurf/Profiles/Profile.swift`,
  `ProfileStore.swift`). Each profile has its own website data store,
  database, permission file and extension directory. A path that lets data
  from one profile reach another is a defect.
- Website permissions (`WSurf/Web/Privacy/SitePermissions.swift`,
  `PermissionCenter.swift`, `NotificationBridge.swift`). A permission belongs to
  one origin: the scheme, the host and the port. A page that is not on TLS is
  refused without asking the person. Camera, microphone, location and
  notifications are for the main frame only, and what a page is told about its
  permission has to match what WSurf stored. A frame using the containing page’s
  permission, or a page receiving an incorrect permission status, is a defect.
- The lyrics lookup (`WSurf/Media/Lyrics/LyricsModel.swift`). WSurf sends the
  track and artist names to lrclib.net, only while the setting is on and never
  for a private tab. A lookup from a private tab, or one made while the setting
  is off, is a defect.
